# Tests for briefs/_EXAMPLE-gc-content.md.
#
# Each test checks one decision from the brief's Requirements, using toy
# sequences short enough that the right answer is obvious by eye. If a test
# fails, its name tells you which decision the implementation got wrong.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW PYTEST WORKS
# Run:  pytest tests/test_gc_content.py -v
#
# pytest finds every function whose name starts with test_ and runs it.
# With -v it prints each test's name followed by PASSED or FAILED.
#
# A test PASSES if its function runs to the end without an error.
# A test FAILS if:
#   - an assert line turns out to be false, or
#   - the code raises an error the test didn't expect.
#
# The building blocks used below:
#
#   assert A == B
#       Checks that A equals B. If it doesn't, the test fails and pytest
#       prints both values, so you can see what the code actually returned.
#
#   with pytest.raises(ValueError):
#       some_code()
#       Checks that the indented code raises a ValueError. If it raises no
#       error, or a different one, the test fails.
#
# The lines from "import sys" down to "from ... import ..." are setup: they
# let Python find the code in src/. They aren't tests.
